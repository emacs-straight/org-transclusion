    What are the allowed (intended?) or tested "things"?

I've briefly tested these:

    word
    symbol
    line (redundant, since we already have :lines)

forward-thing is the function used for selecting multiple things. Some gotchas from some of the less common things could stem from this not handing them as expected.

I expect these will be more common:

    sentence
    paragraph
    defun
    sexp
    list


#+transclude: [[./things-at-point-dir/story.txt::Once upon a time][story]]  :end "2" :thing-at-point paragraph

#+transclude: [[./things-at-point-dir/story.txt::Once upon a time][story]]  :end "3" :thing-at-point sentence

#+transclude: [[./things-at-point-dir/baz.el::id:1234567890][barz-baz-fuzz]]  :src elisp

#+transclude: [[./things-at-point-dir/baz.el::foo][barz-baz-fuzz]]  :src elisp :thing-at-point sexp
